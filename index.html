                    Hello! My name is Nikita, but i preferred( some why ) to be called nikee. <br>
                    I'm 14 yrs old, and learning myself being a developer. <br>
                    I had worked with much from games to websites, and i find it a lot fun to code it! <br>
                    <br>
                    I therefore, like very much to code and have tried to code some stuff you can find on my github website: https://nikeedev.github.io/  <br>
                    <br>
                    I have made some python( like my game: "Cooking game", or Astro ), C#( Unity and MonoGame( very nice framework to make games on, and so easy!!)) and C++. <br>
                    <br>
                    Although i failed around 30 times on every game and project i worked on, i still just beginning to understand what coding is, and already in August 2021, i have coded in 1 year ( yay! ). <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
